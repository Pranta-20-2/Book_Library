1) Homepage Display with Fake Data:
The homepage of the website displays a curated list of books fetched from a fake data file.
Each book is represented with its title, author, cover image, and basic details.

2) Individual Book Details Page:
Clicking on a book's title or image leads to a dedicated page displaying the full details of the book.
Detailed information includes synopsis, publication details, genre, and user reviews.

3) Read List and Wish List Functionality:
On the individual book details page, users have the option to add the book to either their "Read List" or "Wish List" by clicking respective buttons.
The data of the selected book is stored locally in the browser's storage system.
Books added to the "Read List" are automatically excluded from being added to the "Wish List" to avoid redundancy.

4) Sorting Option:
Users can sort the list of books on both the homepage and individual book details page based on criteria such as rating, page number and publish year.
Sorting is implemented dynamically using JavaScript to rearrange the displayed books according to the user's preference.

5) Graphical Representation of Book Items:
The website generates a graphical representation, typically in the form of a graph or chart, illustrating statistics related to the books added by the user.
Graphs may depict information such as the distribution of books across genres, average ratings, or the number of books in the user's "Read List" versus "Wish List".
Graphs are interactive and provide users with insights into their reading preferences and habits.
